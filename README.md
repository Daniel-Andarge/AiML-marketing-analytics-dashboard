# AiML-marketing-analytics-dashboard

The Marketing Analytics Dashboard project is a comprehensive solution designed to monitor and evaluate the efficiency of marketing ads for a tech-savvy bank in Ethiopia. By collecting data from various sources such as Tikvah-Ethiopia channel, Play Store, and Telegram subscriptions, the project aims to provide key insights on ad performance, app downloads, and telegram channel subscriptions. The dashboard system is connected to a PostgreSQL data warehouse, ensuring real-time data updates and enabling the marketing and sales team to make data-driven decisions to optimize their marketing strategy.
